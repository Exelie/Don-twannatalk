    <h1>Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance<br>
        I don't wanna talk, no more</h1>

    <h4>Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance<br>
        I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby<br>
        Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance<br>
        And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had</h4>

    <p>We kissed in the morning on a summer day<br>
        You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes<br>
        There's a warning written in the corners of your face<br>
        Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail</p>
    
    <h4>Now I know it's safe to say<br>
        Nothing's perfect anyway</h4>
    
    <p>you fell in love, but you don't know how<br>
        We were good once, but I fucked up now (you say)<br>
        I was dumb trying to work things out<br>
        I built a house and you burned it down</p>
    
    <h4>Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance<br>
        I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby<br>
        Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance<br>
        And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had</h4>
    
    <p>Just a minute now, there's something different now<br>
        All your morning sounds, how's it all so loud?<br>
        Put the flowers down 'cause they look like clouds<br>
        Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out</p>
    
    <h4>Now I know it's safe to say<br>
        Nothing's perfect anyway</h4>
